## Prelude

Complete the tasks in any order you prefer.

It's not necessary to complete all tasks.

You can use any dependencies and frameworks you like for each task. While the project skeleton is in Java, you're free to choose any programming language.

The goal is to understand your coding style and how you approach the tasks.
